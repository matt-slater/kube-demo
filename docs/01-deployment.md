# Rebel Base

As you can see managing individual pods and their configuration can be very time-consuming. Wouldn't it be nice if the pods could restart when there was a failure? Or if we could spin up several instances of a pod at the same time?

### Deployments

We arent going to get anywhere with just one X wing going up against the Death Star, so let's deploy a Rebel Base from which we can command our fleet of rebel fighters more efficiently.

### ConfigMaps

Let's externalize our Rebel Base configuration from the app itself.
